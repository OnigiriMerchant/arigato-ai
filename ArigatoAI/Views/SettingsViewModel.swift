import Foundation

/// Observable view-model for ``SettingsView`` (UI #19).
///
/// Owns the small slice of state SwiftUI binds to: the latest
/// ``StorageStats`` snapshot, an in-flight load/load-error pair, a
/// pending destructive ``PendingAction``, two per-action busy flags,
/// and the last action's result for surfacing inline.
///
/// ## Scheduling assumption — re-entry guard
///
/// ``confirmPending()`` is **re-entry guarded**. If a clear-cache or
/// delete-all call is already in flight (`isClearingCache ||
/// isDeletingAll`), a subsequent invocation is a no-op. SwiftUI's
/// confirmation-dialog button cannot in practice produce concurrent
/// taps, but a test-driven race that calls `confirmPending()` twice
/// from independent tasks must observe exactly one downstream call
/// (one `clearPromptCache` on the provider OR one `deleteAllMeetings`
/// on the store). Named violation test:
/// ``confirmPending_whileInFlight_isNoOp`` — spawns two concurrent
/// `confirmPending()` calls against a fake provider whose
/// `clearPromptCache` blocks until externally signaled, and asserts
/// the provider observed exactly one invocation.
///
/// ## Scheduling assumption — stats reload sequencing
///
/// After a successful destructive op, ``confirmPending()`` calls
/// ``load()`` to refresh ``stats``. APFS metadata-cache lag may cause
/// the immediately-subsequent ``StorageStatsProviding/currentStats()``
/// to report non-zero `lfm2CacheBytes` for a few hundred milliseconds
/// after a cache clear; the next refresh (or any subsequent settings
/// open) will reflect the deletion. No named violation test — FS
/// metadata lag is not testably observable from Swift Testing under
/// the project's harness.
